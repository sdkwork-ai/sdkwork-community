# H5 Application Agent Instructions

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Resolve this standards root once and use it as the global authority for the current task:

- `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`

Read only the relevant README task-matrix row or navigation heading, then load the selected authority sections.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`
Build scripts, dev runners, and `pnpm clean` must follow `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7 (Build Source Integrity And Self-Healing). Git-tracked build-critical source files must be verified before builds and self-healed from git when missing; `clean` must not delete them.


Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

This is an H5 application root for the community product. It follows `APP_H5_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` for application architecture.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: local agent entrypoint and relative SDKWORK spec index.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: application manifest for H5/Capacitor deployment.
- `etc/`: deployable-root source configuration and typed runtime profiles.
- `.sdkwork/`: reserved local dictionary folder for local skills, plugins, manifests, or AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: local component/application specs that extend root standards.
- `sdks/`: SDK families, OpenAPI authorities, route manifests, and generated SDK artifacts.
- `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: language/build manifests.
- Local directories to inspect first when relevant: `packages/`, `src/`, `config/`, `scripts/`.

## Spec Resolution Order

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task: resolve the selected root and task category before reading broad source context.

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` routing material and classify the owned surface.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, module `specs/`, repository/application `specs/`, and `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches the contract each item governs.
3. Locate only the relevant task-matrix row or navigation heading in `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`; do not load the full catalog.
4. Read only the task-specific global spec sections selected by that route, then inspect implementation files.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` when present.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` when present.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` when relevant.
5. Read `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md` and the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files only after the relevant dictionary entries are clear.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- H5 application changes: `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_H5_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_MOBILE_REACT_UI_SPEC.md`
- Agent/workflow changes: `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../../../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`.

## Code Style Rules

Use `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` for authored changes, then load only the language or framework authority touched by the current task.

## Build, Test, and Verification

<!-- SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->
Choose only the narrowest verification selected by the changed surface. This is not a default full-suite command list.
Run workspace-wide checks only when the change crosses that boundary.
`bootstrap-*`, `align-*`, `sync-*`, `--write`, and other mutating repair commands are not verification defaults; use them only for an explicitly scoped repair, migration, bootstrap, or alignment task and inspect the resulting diff.
<!-- /SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->

Run commands from this directory unless a command explicitly targets another path.

- `pnpm install`: install dependencies for this workspace or package.
- `pnpm run test`: run the configured test suite for this scope.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: run TypeScript type checks.
- `pnpm run verify`: run repository verification or architecture checks.

Run the narrowest relevant check first, then broader verification when API contracts, SDK generation, persistence, security, or cross-package boundaries change.

## Agent Execution Rules

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task; treat indexes and cross-references as discovery, not as a startup bundle.
Keep `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` and the task-selected standards authoritative; expand context only when evidence exposes a new contract boundary.
Language-specific specs are on-demand: only the touched language loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, or `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.
Package command standardization loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` only when the current task changes package commands or scripts; GitHub packaging work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md` only when it reaches that workflow boundary.
Do not infer a recursive workspace scan or a broad validation suite from the presence of a path alone.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use the convention dictionary instead of broad context loading. Do not hand-edit generated SDK output unless the task is explicitly about generated artifacts and the source contract is verified. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP. Keep changes scoped to the owning module, package, crate, or app root. Record the exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## HTTP API Response Envelope

All L2+ SDKWork-owned custom HTTP contracts, including `app-api`, `backend-api`, and SDKWork-owned business `open-api`, `MUST` follow `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5, section 14, and section 15:

- **Default classification:** omitted `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol` means SDKWork-owned custom API (`sdkwork-v3`); only operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` plus `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` identifies a third-party compatibility `open-api` operation.
- **Input:** typed request bodies, section 14.1 list/search/command input, `SdkWorkListQuery`, and `q` for free-text search.
- **Success output:** `SdkWorkApiResponse` with `{ "code": 0, "data": <payload>, "traceId": "<server-uuid>" }`.
- **Error output:** HTTP 4xx/5xx `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) with numeric `code` and `traceId`; SDKWork-owned errors may include `i18nKey` and `locale` presentation metadata.
- Success `code` is numeric `int32`; HTTP 2xx JSON bodies `MUST` use `0` only. REST semantics remain on HTTP status (`201`, `202`, etc.).
- Platform error codes are numeric non-zero values per section 15.3 (`40001`, `40101`, `40401`, …).
- Single resource: `data.item`
- Lists: `data.items` + `data.pageInfo` (`PageInfo.mode` is `offset` or `cursor`)
- Commands: `data.accepted` plus optional `resourceId` / `status`
- Async accept (`202`): `data.operationId`, `data.status`, optional `pollUrl`
- Operation patterns: retrieve/list/search/create/update/delete/command/async/bulk semantics follow `API_SPEC.md` section 15.4; create uses `201`, delete uses `204` with no JSON body, and `PUT`/`PATCH` use SDK action `update`.

Vendor compatibility `open-api` routes that mirror upstream tool or provider wire (for example OpenAI `/v1/*`, Anthropic/Claude `/anthropic/v1/*`, Google/Gemini `/google/v1beta/*`, Claude Code, or Codex) `MAY` opt out only when every exempt operation declares operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` and `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` per `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5.2. SDKWork-owned business `open-api` operations `MUST NOT` opt out. Mixed OpenAPI documents are validated per operation; one external operation never exempts SDKWork-owned operations in the same document.

Errors `MUST` use HTTP 4xx/5xx with `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) including required numeric `code` and `traceId`. Optional `i18nKey` and `locale` are display metadata only. Business failures `MUST NOT` use HTTP 2xx with non-zero `code`, string wire codes, `success`, or human `message`.

Forbidden legacy envelopes and fields: `PlusApiResult`, `AppbaseApiResult`, `StoreApiResult`, `SdkWorkResponse`, per-domain `*ApiResult`, wire field `requestId`, bare domain DTOs at the HTTP root, and top-level `{ items, pageInfo, traceId }` without `data`.

Handlers `MUST` serialize success and map errors through `sdkwork-web-framework` response mapping. Generated HTTP SDKs (`--standard-profile sdkwork-v3`) unwrap `data` by default and expose typed numeric `ProblemDetail.code` / `traceId` and returned localization metadata on errors; use `.raw` when the full envelope is required.

Before completing API contract, SDK generation, or frontend service work, run:

```bash
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-response-envelope.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
```

Authority: `sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` section 4.5 and sections 14–16, `SDK_SPEC.md` section 4.2, `FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` section 4.2.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWORK standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing database migrations or production deployment config, deleting data/files, or changing generated SDK ownership. Surface unresolved spec paths, app identity conflicts, component ownership conflicts, and API authority ambiguity instead of guessing.
